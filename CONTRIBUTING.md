# Contributing

The relenv project team welcomes contributions from the community. If you wish to contribute code and you have not signed our [contributor license agreement](https://cla.vmware.com/cla/1/preview), our bot will update the issue when you open a Pull Request.

# Getting the Code

The code is available under the saltstack organization on github.  We use the fork and branch workflow,
so once you've created your own fork, go ahead and clone it to start hacking!

```
git clone git@github.com:<username>/relenv.git
```
